# Mancala-Board-Game-
The African game, mancala, was created using C. The game gives the user the option of playing with another user or with a computer. The game is developed in which each player has six bowls and one mancala. The game begins with four marbles placed into each bowl, while both mancalas are left empty with the objective of the game being that the player to collect the most stones in his/her mancala. The player also has the option of moving either clockwise or counter clockwise. Also, as the player makes a move, if the last stone a player drops during a turn lands in his/her own mancala, then the player immediately gets to have another turn.  However, if a player drops the last stone into one of his/her empty bowls on his/her side, then that last stone, plus all the stones in the opponent's corresponding bowl, are immediately placed in the in the player's mancala.
